# Neural-Network-MNIST
A little application that predicts the digits written by the user.

## Instructions
1. Draw a digit from 0 to 9 across the canvas.
2. Press enter and watch the prediction of the neural network in the console.
3. Press space to clear the canvas.
4. Repeat and experiment :)

## About the project
This is my first little project on machine learning and neural networks. The basic network was written from scratch without the use of libraries like TensorFlow.
I programmed it with the help of the following book: 'Make Your Own Neural Network' by Tariq Rashid.

### MNIST Dataset
The neural network was trained with the MNIST Dataset. The network is pre-trained so you can use it without downloading the MNIST Dataset.
However, if you want to train or test the network by yourself you can download the train and test files from [here](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/)
and put them in the following directory: res/mnist/mnist_test.csv and res/mnist/mnist_train.csv.
