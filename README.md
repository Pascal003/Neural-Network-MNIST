# Neural-Network-MNIST
A little application that predicts the digits written by the user.

## Instructions
1. Draw a digit from 0 to 9 across the canvas.
2. Press enter and watch the prediction of the neural network in the console.
3. Press space to clear the canvas.
4. Repeat and experiment :)

## About the project
This is my first little project on machine learning and neural networks. The network was written from scratch without the use of libraries like TensorFlow.
It's a very basic neural network that is trained with the MNIST-Dataset.
I programmed it with the help of the following book: 'Make Your Own Neural Network' by Tariq Rashid.
